\chapter{Spatio-temporal data}
The term \emph{spatial} data refers to data where each object has associated with it a location.
Naturally, \emph{spatio-temporal} data also include a temporal coordinate.
Spatial data have been collected, processed and visualized from the early history of mankind.
Conversely until today, the representation and visualization of spatio-temporal data
is problematic despite of great effort of researches all over the world.

Peuquet \cite{peuquet2001} provides an overview of the development of spatio-temporal data representation.
One of the first areas which needed to handle temporal data were banking systems,
where storing temporal information about financial transactions is crucial.
This encouraged the DBMS (\emph{Database Management System}) to explore the possibilities of handling
temporal data. Simultaneously, a temporal database query language was being developed, which resulted in TSQL2 \cite{snodgrass1995}.
There was an attempt to incorporate certain parts of this language into new SQL standard SQL:1999,
however the TSQL2 was later critized \cite{darwen2005}.
Recently, a new set of language extensions for temporal data support became a part of
SQL:2011 \cite{kulkarni2012}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ST models %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Spatio-temporal data models}
The capabilities of any information system depend on the design of its data models.
Spatio-temporal data modeling involves defining object data types,
relations and operations, and ensuring database integrity \cite{pelekis2004}.
Apart from that, a data model should take into account possible spatio-temporal queries and performed analyzes.

We have succeeded in modeling of spatial information;
current geographical information systems use raster, vector model or the combination of both.
Nonetheless, to model temporal information together with spatial information
has proved to be more complicated \cite{peuquet2001}.

In the following paragraphs, several spatio-temporal data models are described.
There is quite a large number of spatio-temporal data models (\cite{pelekis2004} identifies 11 distinct models), however
I decided to present only certain models which are frequently discussed in related literature.
The brief description should give an idea of spatio-temporal modeling
and it shows how spatio-temporal models vary.

\paragraph*{The snapshot model}
One of the simplest field-based spatio-temporal data models is the snapshot model.
This representation consists of a sequence of layers,
where each layer shows a state recorded at a certain point in time.
Hence, this model can be perceived as a 3D or 4D space-time cube \cite{peuquet2001}.


The main drawback is the redundancy of data when there is little change between two successive states.
Also, it is not convenient to describe changes in space through time because the model captures only states.
Due to missing temporal structure, it is difficult to enforce integrity rules
and resolve all possible types of queries \cite{pelekis2004}.
It can be even compared to spaghetti model, term related to vector topology.
On the other hand, the advantage of this model is its simplicity;
it's implementation and usage is quite straightforward and intuitive.
In addition, it can be easily used to extend existent layer-based GIS.

To alleviate the problem of storing redundant data, an alternative approach,
\emph{Base state with Amendments} was suggested \cite{langran1988}.
This approach models changes instead of states.
The state can be retrieved by amending changes to the main state.
In order to improve the efficiency of retrieving a distant state,
various approaches have been suggested \cite{wang2012},
differing in the choice of base state or states and in the number and distribution of difference files.

\paragraph*{The space-time composite data model}
This model was suggested by Langran \cite{langran1988}. It assumes vector data representation.
The base map in this model is gradually fragmented as the changes occur.
Each fragment has its own attribute history represented by an ordered list of records.
To obtain a state at a point in time, all fragments are retrieved and common spatial boundaries are dissolved.
This model is conceptually straightforward, however the updating process may be more time consuming \cite{pelekis2004}
comparing to other models.
% The fragmentation requires to change identifiers each time when an old fragment is split into two new parts

\paragraph*{Event-oriented models}
According to \cite{temporalGlossary}, event ``\emph{is an instantaneous fact, i.e., something occurring at an instant}''.
The models mentioned above cannot clearly represent events.
In order to overcome this problem, events can be represented explicitly.
Several event-based models have been suggested by \cite{claramunt1995managing}, \cite{peuquet1995}, \cite{chen1998event}.

We can explain the basic concept of event-oriented models by describing
the raster-based approach implemented%
\footnote{The actual implementation used GRASS GIS for storing base map \cite{peuquet1995}.}
by Peuquet and Duan, called
\emph{Event-based Spatio Temporal Data Model} (ESTDM)  \cite{peuquet1995}.
This model stores changes associated with each time instance in an event list.
Every event from this list points to a list of event components,
which describe where changes occur (using efficient data structures).
Events are connected; every event has a pointer to the previous and the following event.
Similarly to the concept of amendments, there is also a base map, showing an initial snapshot.
ESTDM assumes that each event list and associated changes relate to a single thematic domain.

\paragraph*{Object-oriented models}
As object-oriented design showed promising results in the field of programming,
there were efforts to apply its features, such as classes and instances, attributes and methods,
inheritance and polymorphism, in spatio-temporal data model.

An object-oriented approach was for the first time applied by Worboys \cite{worboys1994unified}.
He suggested a unified spatio-temporal object (\emph{ST-complex}) which combines spatial component
with bitemporal component (event and database time). ST-complex is a collection of \emph{ST-simplexes}
where the spatial component represents a point, a straight line segment or a triangular area.
Operations like union, difference, boundary or spatial and temporal projection are defined for the ST-object.

Object-oriented models seem to have more advantages and less drawbacks comparing to other models.
Pelekis \cite{pelekis2004} claims that it can ``\emph{support  all types of data handling,
in terms of measurement, topological relationships and operations}''.

\paragraph{The three domains model}
The three domains model was described by Yuan \cite{yuan1994wildfire} and it was originally applied for wildfire modeling.
As the name suggests, the model has three domains, semantics, time, and space, which are interlinked.
In case of wildfire modeling, semantic domain can contain names of fire events, types or fire intensity.
The time domain describes the existence of semantic and spatial objects (like geometrical primitives, cells and volumes).
Each domain can be handled separately in terms of database management system.
Thanks to the splitting of the spatio-temporal information,
this model is flexible enough to support wide range of spatio-temporal queries \cite{pelekis2004}.
The interesting aspect is that both splitting (the case of the three domains model)
and unifying (the case of the object-oriented model) can lead to good results.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Visualization %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Visualization}
Visualizing the world (through geospatial data) has been a cartographic interest for many centuries.
Current advanced software and hardware enable us to visualize geospatial data in many different ways,
however, existing visualization and exploratory techniques often do not suffice, especially in the temporal domain.

Visualization of spatio-temporal data is closely related to the term \emph{temporal map}.
Kraak and MacEachren \cite{kraak1994visualization} define temporal maps as
``\emph{a representation or abstraction of changes in geographical reality:
a tool (that is visual, digital or tactile) for presenting geographical information
whose locational and/or attribute components change over time}''.
They distinguish three categories of maps:
    \begin{description}
        \item[A single static map] represents an event by means of graphic sign system\,---\,from complex point symbols,
            temporal glyphs, to generalized trend-surface or flow-linkage maps depicting movement \cite{monmonier1990strategies}.

        \item[A strip map] represents an event by ordering `state' maps chronologically (as in `comic strip' style).
            Each map shows the state of the geographical reality at a unique time instance.
            The number of maps is rather limited because it is not possible to display long series of images
            due to lack of space (on paper or screen). Also, it would be too difficult to follow all these images.

        \item[Animated maps] represent an event by a quick chronological sequence of static maps.
            A typical example of animated map is shown during the weather forecast on television,
            where it depicts changing atmosphere's conditions.
            Fly-through animations are not considered to be temporal maps
            as long as there is no change in the spatial component (i.e.\ landscape).
    \end{description}

MacEachren \cite{maceachren1997exploratory} suggests a concept of visualization
where map usage is treated as a cube;
the axes represent the user of map (private vs.\ public),
objectives of use (revealing unknowns vs.\ presenting knowns)
and degree of interactivity (high vs.\ low).
One of the corners (private users, revealing unknowns and high interactivity)
represents \emph{visualization} and the opposite one \emph{communication}.
All maps involve both visualization (exploratory analysis leading to revealing new information)
and communication (delivery of desired information to map user),
however they differ in which component they underline.
Both components are important; first the researcher need to analyze the data
and then he explains his findings to the public.
In the following paragraphs I will focus mostly on the exploratory use of visualization tools.

In \cite{andrienko2003exploratory}, Andrienko et al.\ provide a review
of general exploratory techniques used for analysis of spato-temporal data.
They based the task typology on work
%of Bertin \cite{bertin1983semiology}
of Peuquet \cite{peuquet1994s}.
She distinguished three view components in spatio-temporal data:
\emph{where} (space), \emph{when} (time) and \emph{what} (object).
This leads to three basic kinds of question:
\begin{description}
    \item[when + where $\rightarrow$ what:]
        Describe the objects or set of objects (what) that are present
        at a given location or set of locations (where)
        at a given time or set of time (when).

    \item [when + what $\rightarrow$ where:]
        Describe the location or set of locations (where) occupied
        by a given object or set of objects (what) at
        a given time or set of times (when).

    \item [where + what $\rightarrow$ when:]
        Describe the times or set of times (when) that a given
        object or set of objects (what) occupied a
        given location or set of locations (where).
 \end{description}

For the purpose of their work, Andrienko et al. simplified this classification into two cases:
    \begin{description}
        \item[when $\rightarrow$ where + what:]
            Time is given and other information (location, characteristics) has to be found out.
        \item[where + what $\rightarrow$ when:]
            With other types of information, time has to be discovered.

     \end{description}
 

\subsection{Exploratory techniques}
Unlike paper maps, computer-based visualization tools offer many important features
such as interactivity and dynamics which are necessary for most exploratory techniques
like map querying or animation.

\subsubsection{Querying}
A query consists of two main parts\,---\,target and constraints \cite{andrienko2003exploratory}.
For example, we can ask where (target) a particular object was located at a given time instance (constraint).
A query can be specified by the user either by a machine-readable language (typically Structured Query Language)
or via graphical user interface (possibly using Visual Query Languages \cite{catarci1997visual})
which is usually more convenient for end-users who then tend to perform tasks faster.
An example of dynamic query tools which constrain the query can be found
in \cite{ahlberg1992dynamic} and \cite{hochheiser2004dynamic}.
However, dynamic query tools usually do not allow to build a more complicated query;
for example, when logical \emph{OR} and \emph{AND} are combined.

% Often, the query constraints are specified by a mouse cursor pointing at a location on map.

In case of temporal queries, specific graphical user interface
might be needed. Figure \ref{fig:cyclical_time} shows a temporal query tool
which enables to select arbitrary combinations of years, month, days and hours.


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./images/cyclical_time.png}
  \caption{Widget for temporal queries from system TEMPEST (Source:
      \url{http://w ww.geovista.psu.edu/products/demos/edsall/Tclets072799/cyclicaltime.htm})}
  \label{fig:cyclical_time}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Map iteration}
Map iteration corresponds to the term ``strip maps'' mentioned before.
Temporal information is presented as a juxtaposition of several maps.
Each map represents one state of a phenomenon at an time instance.
This technique can be used with both conventional maps and maps on computer screens.
Also, it is applicable for all type of spatio-temporal data.

The technique of map iteration is suitable
for both type of tasks mentioned above.
Change (thus `when $\rightarrow$ where + what' in terms of comparing two time moments)
can be detected by map iteration technique by shifting the focus from one map to the other.

This task can be made even easier by overlaying one map over the other providing that the upper map is semitransparent.
This makes the changes more visible.
However, from my own experience, such a tool should allow the user to change the transparency level dynamically
because certain changes might be revealed easier at a different level of transparency.
Similar approach is the fading technique.
One map gradually disappears while the next map emerges from beneath of it.

Another variation on the topic which is not mentioned in \cite{andrienko2003exploratory}
is `swipe' technique.
It allows the user to interactively compare two layers (typically raster)
of the same area by revealing different parts of the maps (see for example figure \ref{fig:swipe}).


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./images/swipe_example.png}

\end{figure}

% , where + what $\rightarrow$ when).

\subsubsection{Map animation}
% consider (sub)paragraphs - dynamic vis. variables, temporal legend
Unlike map iteration, map animation is a technique which is applicable for computer screens only.
Nonetheless, there is only a few steps from map iteration to map animation.
Instead of displaying a series of static maps, there is a single map but its content changes.
The changes representing an event are inferred from real movement on the map.
Animation consists of frames\,---\,single images (maps).

Animations can be useful to reveal trends, processes and subtle spatio-temporal patterns
that are not evident in static representation. Dorling and Openshaw \cite{dorling1993using}
demonstrated a power of animated maps to stimulate knowledge;
they investigated childhood leukemia rates in northern England during twenty years.
Thanks to the animation the previously unrecognized hot-spots (localized both in space and time) emerged
as well as the oscillation between the rise and fall of the incidence of
cases in Newcastle and Manchester. Since time component was not considered in previous studies,
they failed to reveal these patterns.

Animation can be used to visualize routes of moving objects \cite{andrienko2003exploratory}.
Unlike static representations, animation can reveal details about speed, acceleration and interaction
of the individual objects. Consider the case when the trajectories of two objects cross each other.
Without animation we are not able to decide if the objects really met or
if they just arrived at the same place in a different moment.
There are three alternative approaches to visualize object movement by animation \cite{andrienko2003exploratory}:
    \begin{description}
        \item[Snapshot in time] The simplest approach is based on displaying the objects
        at their location at the given time instance. This method is usually not convenient for more than one object.
        \item[Movement history] Beside the objects, also their trajectories are displayed from the starting point.
        When the animation ends, complete trajectories are shown. This approach prevents the user from loosing track,
        however in case of more complicated trajectories, the situation might become too complex.
        \item[Time window] Similarly to the previous approach, trajectories are displayed.
        However only a part of the trajectories corresponding to the last few time units are visible,
        like the white trails leaved behind by a plane.
        This method solves the drawback of the `movement history' method.
    \end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In \cite{dibiase1992animation}, DiBiase et al.\ introduced three dynamic visualization variables of animation:
\emph{duration}, \emph{rate of change}, \emph{order}.
Three more variables were added by MacEachren \cite{maceachren2004maps}:
\emph{frequency}, \emph{display time} and \emph{synchronization}.
According to Kraak \cite{kraak2000visualisation}, duration and order are the most important
dynamic variables. Duration is the time interval during which no change on the display occurs.
Order, the succession of individual frames, together with duration can be used to
\emph{``express an animation's narrative character''}\cite{kraak2000visualisation}.
Frequency is the number of identifiable states per unit of display time.
Despite the fact that frequency is the dual of duration,
\emph{``it is worth treating as a separate dynamic variable because \ldots
humans react to frequency as if it were an independent variable''} \cite{kraak1994visualization}.
Display time, also called \emph{moment of display}, refers to the time when some display change is initiated.
According to Blok  \cite{blok2005dynamic}, synchronization and rate of change are not dynamic variables
but effects of interaction with other dynamic variables.

The last mentioned variable, synchronization, refers to the possibility to run two or more
animations simultaneously. This might reveal synchronization of patterns between (possibly related) phenomena.
Also it may be useful to experiment with different starting moments of animations.
This allows to explore cause-effect relationships between phenomena, for example
the delayed effect of precipitation on vegetation growth.
However, it is unclear whether an analyst is able to effectively watch two or more simultaneous
juxtaposed animations \cite{andrienko2003exploratory}. More research need to be conducted.
Using the eye-tracking technology seems to be one possible approach
(see for example study \cite{opach2011evaluating}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In \cite{kraak1997cartographic}, Kraak et al.\ deal with temporal legend for animations.
Temporal legend is the part of the interface which does not only help to understand and interpret
the phenomenon but it can also serve as navigation tool to control dynamically the animation.
In order to explore spatio-temporal data, animation should offer functionality like replaying, pausing
and going to a particular frame.
Temporal legend can differ according to the type of displayed data.
For example, certain kinds of data, like hourly measured temperature, have naturally perceived periodic pattern.
For those data, clock-like legend might be more suitable.
However it describes only the temporal location within one cycle.

On the other hand, for several kinds of data linear time representation is more natural (e.g.\ erosion process)
and for this case a slide bar, where the marker shows the current temporal location, would be a better choice.
Both types of temporal legends could be accompanied by numerical legend (e.g.\ 23:14,  March 2012, \ldots)
as suggested by Kraak \cite{kraak1997cartographic}.
However, a study showed that the choice among these three types of legend has no significant effect on
the performance, response times or correctness of results \cite{edsall1997assessing}.

Another types of temporal legend for animation can try to avoid the distracting the user.
Sound legend can signalize either the date and time or the animation frequency (by ticking).
Another approach applicable only for certain data is based on changing the brightness of the screen
to induce an illusion of day and night.

\subsubsection{Space-time cube}
The space-time cube is basically a 3D plot in which the spatial component (e.g.\ a geographic map)
is plotted in the $xy$\nobreakdash-plane and the temporal domain is represented
on the vertical $z$-axis.
This new view on time as an additional spatial dimension was introduced in 1970 by Hägerstrand \cite{hagerstrand1970}.
He suggested a three-dimensional diagram, the space-time cube, to study the space-time behavior of human individuals.
In those days, creating graphics was limited to manual methods.
Therefore creating an alternative view on the cube, which is essential for this visualization technique,
required an arduous drawing process. Today, thanks to modern computer technologies, much better opportunities
for visualization are provided. As a result, researchers bring back this concept and
investigate it in order to use it as a new exploratory tool.

Space-time cube is a concept which is applicable for various analyses and type of data.
We can find several different employment of space-time cube in literature.
The usages differ in the purpose of analysis which is then closely related
to the type of analyzed data (vector lines, points, voxel data).

The original Hägerstrand's concept was concerned with movement of objects (people).
During day each person follows a trajectory through space and time called
\emph{space-time path}. Figure \ref{fig:st-path} shows a simplified example
of persons movements during a working day. The locations where people stay,
called \emph{stations} (e.g.\ at home, at work), are represented by a vertical direction of the path.
However in a larger scale, we could observe movement at these stations
(people moving inside buildings). The time when people meet at a station is called \emph{activity bundle}.

Figure \ref{fig:st-prism} schematically shows a \emph{space-time prism}
which indicates the locations that can be reached in a particular time interval
(starting and returning to the same place). In reality, it is not circular because
not all places are accessible.

\label{fig:st-path-prism}
\end{figure}


Space-time paths are naturally applied to movement data, such as public transport data \cite{transport2005visualisation}.
Apart from that, space-time paths are often used to analyze sociological aspects
as for example in the study focused on non-employment activities with regard to gender \cite{kwan1999gender}.
In \cite{moore2003time}, this technique was used in sport to analyze rugby matches.
Additionally, Kraak \cite{kraak2005visualization} suggests to use it for real-time monitoring which is possible thanks to
the boom of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) technologies.
Another discipline which may benefit from the space-time paths approach is archeology.
Kraak \cite{kraak2005visualization} provides an example of space-time paths representing
archeology excavations where the stations indicate the duration of the existence of settlements.
Another study concentrated on the interaction of cultures using a combination of the space-time cube approach
with graph theory \cite{huisman2008development}.



% understand An Evaluation of Space Time Cube Representation of Spatiotemporal Patterns

% GNSS influenced makes collecting



Space-time cube concept is suitable not only to represent moving objects
but it can be successfully applied to events, too.
Gatalsky et al.\ \cite{gatalsky2004interactive}
focused on the detection of spatio-temporal patterns in event occurrences.
In their work, events (earthquakes) are represented as circles placed vertically according to their occurrence.
Size and color of each circle reflect the thematic characteristics of the event.
The space-time cube is dynamically linked to a map display so that it is possible to highlight corresponding events.
% By using this method, they were able to find grouping

Another potentially large field of study is the application of space-time cube concept for voxel data.
Mitasova et al.\ \cite{mitasova2011landscape} presents a multidimensional framework for characterization
of land surface dynamics using time series of elevation data (LiDAR point cloud).
Space-time cube, as one part of this framework,
creates a voxel representation of elevation evolution with time as a third dimension.
The evolution of contour-based features (shorelines) is studied
by visualization of multiple isosurfaces extracted from the voxel model%
%(\ref{fig:})
.
In this context, an isosurface represents a contour of given $z$-coordinate (height)
stretched in the vertical time dimension.
% TODO: add images of voxel schema, isosurfaces http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X11002935

Yet another space-time cube approach is used to visualize distributions of
geospatial time-varying data through a pictorial representation \cite{tominski20053d}, \cite{thakur20103d}.
A base map is typically divided into regions or administrative districts.
Above each of these parts, a 3D icon or glyph is drawn.
In \cite{thakur20103d}, the glyph is represented by a set of disks stacked along the vertical temporal axis,
one for each time step. The size of the disk is scaled according to maximum disk size.
Additionally, color is used to encode data values and although it is redundant
(the information is already in the disk size), it can help to detect outliers.

Temporal GRASS GIS Framework is a new extension available in GRASS 7 for manipulating spatio-temporal data.
It enables to manage, analyze and process large amount of spatio-temporal data.
Following the GRASS GIS modular design, the framework introduces over 30 new modules.
Temporal modules' names starting with t./t.rast/t.vect/t.rast3d names
comply with the GRASS modules' naming conventions.

\subsection{Implementation}
\tf uses a snapshot approach (described above).
This approach can be easily understood and is simple enough to be integrated into the layer-based GIS.
The integration consists of two levels.
In the first level, timestamps are assigned to the existing spatial data types -- raster, vector, 3D raster maps.
The second level introduces new datatypes -- space time raster,
vector and 3D raster datasets (referred as stdrs, stvds and str3ds).

The implementation of the \tf is based on a temporal library and a SQL database scheme.
The library is written in Python programming language and provides an application programming interface (API) which is used by the temporal modules,
however the library is meant to be used not only by other modules but also within user scripts or the GRASS GUI if needed.
Beside valid time the temporal database stores also transaction time%
\footnote{Valid time is the time period during which a database fact is valid in the modeled reality,
transaction time  is the time period during which a database fact is stored in the database \cite{temporalGlossary}}
and other map and dataset metadata.
The \tf supports two different database back-ends -- SQLite%
\footnote{\url{http://www.sqlite.org/}} (more lightweight) and
PostgreSQL\footnote{\url{http://www.postgresql.org/}}.
However, GRASS GIS users usually do not have to come in contact with the underlying database backend
as the default SQLite driver is often what they need.

\subsection{Basic concepts}
The \tf follows the concept of linear and discrete time.
To understand the basic concept of the \tf it is necessary to explain several terms.
The terms are explained in the context of the \tf , more theoretical and accurate definitions can be found in \cite{temporalGlossary}.

\paragraph{Interval vs. point time}
\label{sec:intervalVsPoint}
One can decide which time model to use -- interval time or time instances (also called point time).
Point time is a single moment in the time dimension
while interval is a period of time consisting of two instances -- start time instance and end time instance.
The time interval contains the start time but not the end time:
$$[start, end)$$

Each type is suitable for different types of data.
Consider temperature and precipitation measuring.
While temperature is measured in a given time instance and the measured value describes the state,
precipitation is measured over a given time period. The decision which model to choose is not always
straightforward, however it appears that for many applications,
interval time is a better choice \cite{pointVsInterval}.

\paragraph{Absolute vs. relative time}
\label{sec:absoluteVsRelative}
Absolute time stamp is related to a fact and it does not depend on any other facts.
On the contrary, relative time is related to another time and
it can be represented even by a negative number which stands for ``before".
The \tf recognizes several date time formats for absolute time -- TODO.
Relative time format consists of a number and time unit, which can be one the following: \emph{years},
\emph{months}, \emph{days}, \emph{hours}, \emph{minutes} and \emph{seconds} (see table \ref{tab:timeFormat}).

\begin{table}[ht!]
  \centering
\caption{Examples of valid time formats}
\label{tab:timeFormat}
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{3pt}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\multirow{3}{*}{Absolute time}
 & 2001-01-05  \\ \cline{2-2}
 & 1996-07-06 23:01:59  \\\cline{2-2}
 & TODO  \\
 \hline
\multirow{2}{*}{Relative time}
 & 1 months  \\\cline{2-2}
 & -5 years  \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Temporal granularity}
\label{sec:temporalGranularity}
Temporal granularity is an important characteristics of every temporal dataset.
In the context of the \tf , it represents the greatest common divisor
of the temporal extents (and possible gaps) of all maps of the dataset.
The temporal granularity can change every time there is a change in dataset maps
(added, removed or changed time stamp).
To understand better, see table \ref{tab:granularity} content of which is based on the output
of one of the temporal modules (namely \module{t.rast.list}).

Example interval time dataset consists of 6 maps and
there are also two gaps which means that at this time period no data are available.
The column \emph{Duration} contains the number of days for each period and it can be inferred
that the greatest common divisor is 2 months.
\begin{table}[ht!]
  \centering
  \caption{Example dataset}
  \label{tab:granularity}
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{3pt}
\begin{tabular}{cccr}
\toprule

avg\_temp.05@timeseries  &      2002-05-01 00:00:00 &    2002-07-01 00:00:00 &    61.0 \\
avg\_temp.06@timeseries &     2002-07-01 00:00:00  &   2002-09-01 00:00:00   &  62.0\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\paragraph{Temporal topology}
\label{sec:temporalTopology}
Although topology is a term widely used in the area of mathematics studying properties of space,
this term can be used analogically for the time dimension.
Temporal topology analyzes temporal relations between time stamps (for both interval and point time).
There are 13 base relations between two intervals according to \cite{relationships}.
Table \ref{tab:relationships} shows these relations (without the inverse relations).


\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\caption{Temporal relationships according to \cite{relationships}}
\label{tab:relationships}
\setlength{\extrarowheight}{10pt}

% \setlength{\unitlength}{5cm}
% \linethickness{5mm}
\begin{tabular}{|p{6.5cm}|l|}

\hline
\intervals{0cm}{2cm}{3cm}{2cm} \vspace{5pt} &  X before Y   \\\hline
\intervals{0cm}{2cm}{2cm}{2cm} \vspace{5pt} &  X meets Y \\\hline
\intervals{0cm}{3cm}{2cm}{3cm} \vspace{5pt} &  X overlaps with Y  \\\hline
\intervals{0cm}{3cm}{0cm}{5cm} \vspace{5pt} &  X starts Y  \\\hline
\intervals{1cm}{3cm}{0cm}{5cm} \vspace{5pt} &  X during Y  \\\hline
\intervals{2cm}{3cm}{0cm}{5cm} \vspace{5pt} &  X ends Y  \\\hline
\intervals{0cm}{5cm}{0cm}{5cm} \vspace{5pt} &  X equal Y   \\\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The topology of a temporal dataset can be valid or invalid which depends on the relationship between dataset maps.
If certain maps overlap or one is contained by the other then the dataset has invalid topology.
As a consequence, such dataset is not accepted by certain temporal modules.

\paragraph{Temporal sampling}
\label{sec:temporalSampling}
Temporal sampling is used to determine the state of one process during a second process.
The \tf enables to sample a dataset (can have both point and interval time) by another dataset having interval time.
There is an example of temporal sampling in figure \ref{fig:samplingExample}.
The figure indicates that for different sampling methods (temporal relationships)
which are provided by module \module{t.sample}, different results are expected.

In figure \ref{fig:samplingExampleReverse}, the input (sampled) dataset and the sample dataset are interchanged
to demonstrate the reciprocity of the temporal relations. For example, the table \ref{fig:samplingTable} shows that
there is a relation \emph{during} between intervals $Y_2$ and $X_2$, $X_3$.
When the same datasets are interchanged the relation must remain, however it is transformed into \emph{contain}.
The same applies for relations \emph{precede} and \emph{follow}.
Relation \emph{equal} does not have any opposite relation and \emph{overlap} involves both cases (\emph{overlap, overlapped}).
The opposite of the relation \emph{start} is \emph{end} which is not included in \module{t.sample} options.

\subsection{Functionality}
The temporal library provides wide functionality which is accessible either via Python API or GRASS temporal modules.
The main capabilities of the library include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Registration of raster, vector a 3D raster maps in datasets (called \emph{strds}, \emph{stvds}, \emph{str3ds}, respectively).
    \item Support of absolute and relative time (only maps of one type can be in one dataset).
    \item Support of interval and point time (can be used together in one dataset).
    \item Metadata (number of maps, spatial, temporal extent, creation time, \ldots) of a dataset
    are recomputed automatically after (un)registering of maps.
    \item Computation of time granularity.
    \item Computation of temporal topology and reporting its validity.
    \item Temporal sampling of one dataset by another dataset or by its time granularity.
\end{itemize}

Other functionality needed for handling spatio-temporal data is provided by temporal modules.
The integration of the framework into GRASS GIS enables the \tf to reuse existing
functionality to process spatial data.

Temporal modules share certain common options:
\begin{itemize}
  \item They allow to specify the temporal range of datasets so that only a part of a dataset can be processed.
  \item Several modules support two possibilities of specifying the input data\,---\,directly or by providing a file.
  \item When modules output a report or a table it is possible to change the format suitably.
\end{itemize}

The important ability of the \tf is the interoperability
with several powerful open-source applications for statistical computations and visualization.
Textual ouputs of many modules are suitable for statistical environment \emph{R}\footnote{\url{www.r-project.org/}}.
Module \module{r3.out.netcdf} exports 3D raster to NetCDF
format\footnote{\url{http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/netcdf}}
which can be then processed e.g. in \emph{Climate Data Operator (CDO)}\footnote{\url{https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo}}.
The support of visualization software \emph{ParaView}\footnote{\url{http://www.paraview.org/}} is available
through VTK format which can be exported by temporal module \module{t.rast.out.vtk}.

\chapter{Results}%Developed visualization tool

The aim of this work was to develop new tools for better visualization of spatio-temporal data GRASS GIS.
%TODO

\section{Animation tool}
As described in TODO REF animation is a natural and easily understandable way to display spatio-temporal data.

Because the current animation module \module{xganim} was very limited
in several aspects (explained TODO REF), a new tool was developed.

\subsection{Features}
Beside the features of \module{xganim} module, \at provides new possibilities
to explore spatio-temporal data.

Basic features (also existing in \module{xganim} module):
\paragraph{More views}
\at can display up to 4 different synchronized animations at once.
Unlike the \module{xganim} module, it is possible to add or remove each of the views separately
without the need to restart it.
\paragraph{Change animation speed}
Unlike the \module{xganim} module where you can only
slow down or speed up the animation by an unspecified coefficient, \at allows to set
exact duration of the frame (in milliseconds).
\paragraph{Loops}
There are two methods of looping key frames.
The first type cycles through the key frames and when it reaches the last one it jumps back
to the first key frame and continues looping.
The second type of looping goes back through the key frames in reverse order.


New features:
\paragraph{Interactive change of the active frame}
In order to better control currently displayed frame a slider control is provided.
By dragging the slider's knob user can select a certain frame.
Also it enables to inspect in detail a part of an animation
by repeated dragging of the knob back and forth within a few frames.
      
\paragraph{Support of the \tf}
The most important attribute of the \at is the interoperability with the \tf
which involves several features described in section \ref{sec:wx.animation:support}.
      

\paragraph{3D view animation}
A nice feature is the ability to animate raster maps in 3D view.
As illustrated in figure \ref{fig:color_elevation_map},
raster maps can either represent a changing color of a static surface (\subref{fig:color_map}) or
a changing surface (\subref{fig:elevation_map}).
Apart from raster maps, also vector point and line data can be animated, too.
Implementation details can be found in section \ref{sec:3dViewAnimation}.

\end{figure}

        
      
\paragraph{Export}
Animation can be exported either as a sequence of images or an animated gif.
%TODO: add example of ffmpeg command
Sequence of images can be converted to a video file in several ways.
One of the possibilities is to call ffmpeg\footnote{\url{http://ffmpeg.org/}} with the following parameters
      
\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mybash]
ffmpeg -r 10 -i input_%02d.png -sameq -vcodec mpeg4 output.avi
\end{lstlisting}
\end{footnotesize}
      where \emph{-r} stands for frame rate (frames per second),
      \emph{-i} for input files (requires sequential numbering of files) and
      \emph{vcodec} determines the video encoding.
      The export dialog provides the user with the frame rate, so that he can then create
      a video with the same frame rate%
      \footnote{However, not all video codecs and containers support an arbitrary frame rate.} as in the \at.

      A usual requirement is include some additional text, logo or time stamp in the video.
      The \at supports all these options, moreover the number of these decorations is not limited.
      The placement is specified as the percentage of the image size from the top left corner.
      

\subsection{Support of the \tf}
\label{sec:wx.animation:support}
The \at supports the \tf in several ways. Certain features use the \tf in a more complex way than the others.

The \at accepts space time raster dataset as an input. By the means of the \tf, it determines the maps which are then loaded.
Apart from that, also multiple raster maps are accepted directly.

However, the main difference between displaying a set of maps and a space time dataset is
that the duration of each key frame is given by the given time stamp information.
This is useful when data are collected in irregular intervals.
Then, the key frames do not change e.g.\ every second but at a given moment the frame stays visible for a longer time.
To achieve similar behavior it is necessary to add the frame multiple times, see figure \ref{fig:temporalDifference}.
Concerning temporal data having interval time, there are cases when no data were collected or measured at all.
The \at recognizes such cases and displays a ``no data'' sign in order to make the user aware of the gap in data.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering

\caption{Difference in animations of temporal data and non-temporal data collected at irregular intervals}
\label{fig:temporalDifference}

\end{figure}

In case of loading more space time datasets the \tf enables to synchronize the animations
even if the temporal datasets are spaced unequally.
Figure \ref{fig:synchronizedAnim}) presents an example of such datasets and the related table
shows the frames displayed at selected time instances.
The concept of temporal granularity and temporal sampling is used to achieve this described behavior.

$t_4$ & $X_4$& ---\\\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\caption{Synchronized animations of space time datasets $X$ and $Y$}
\label{fig:synchronizedAnim}
\end{figure}

Datasets with interval and point time have to be distinguished.
Displaying interval data means to display each map (frame) for the time interval given by its start and end time.
However, point data have no end time. Therefore a different logic must be used to determine when each map should be displayed.
The \at treats point data as interval data where the end time of one map is the start time of the following map.

The time stamp information extracted from the dataset is presented to the user.
The format is given by the \emph{GRASS Datetime Library}. % which url too put here?
The support of other date time formats is planned.


\subsection{Usage}
There are two ways to launch the \at.
First option is to launch it from Layer Manager menu.
If there are any raster maps selected in the Layer Manager, the \at will load these maps automatically.
This simplifies the workflow of analyzing data as it is not necessary to specify maps several times.

Another option, which might appear more natural to many GRASS users,
is to launch the \at as a module from command line. By typing:

\begin{small}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mybash]
> g.gui.animation
\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}

the \at is launched with no data loaded and the user is supposed to specify maps via the GUI.
Additionally, input data can be specified directly in the command line.
As of any other GRASS module, the parameters of \module{g.gui.animation} command can be retrieved by typing:

\begin{small}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mybash]
> g.gui.animation --help

Description:
 Tool for animating a series of GRASS raster maps
 or a space time raster dataset

Usage:
 g.gui.animation [rast=name[,name,...]] [strds=name] [--verbose]
   [--quiet]

Flags:
 --v   Verbose module output
 --q   Quiet module output

Parameters:
   rast   Raster maps to animate
  strds   Space time raster dataset to animate
\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}

The command line interface does not allow the access to complete functionality of the \at.
The reason is that providing all functionality through command line parameters
would result in too complicated parameters.
Moreover, this simple interface should be sufficient for most cases.


\subsection{Implementation}
While \module{xganim} module was written in wxWidgets using C++ programming language (in GRASS 7),
the \at is written completely in wxPython using Python so that it can be better integrated into the GRASS wxGUI.
It uses \emph{GRASS Python Scripting Library} and \emph{GRASS Python Temporal Library} \cite{grassProgMan},
which is the integral part of the \tf. In the following paragraphs, some of the implementation issues are described.

\subsubsection{Loading data}
It is important to be aware of the fact that animation can consist of hundreds of maps.
Unfortunately, the mechanism of loading raster data in \module{xganim} could not be simply
rewritten into Python because of performance issues.
Therefore it was necessary to choose a different implementation.

If we try to use the \module{xganim} implementation, we encounter two main problems.
First, when loading data, the \emph{GRASS Raster Library} functions \cite{grassProgMan} are called.
In Python we could use ctypes to interface these methods,
however these methods can call exit function which causes a sudden end of the program.
This behavior is sufficient for a module but it is not suitable for a long running GUI application.
Secondly, the image representing the raster map is created by setting the color of each pixel sequentially.
For this kind of operation, Python is too slow comparing to C or C++.
This problem can be alleviated by using NumPy\footnote{\url{http://numpy.scipy.org/}},
however that makes the code less readable.

One possible solution is to use the current system used by wxGUI
where the raster maps are rendered into temporary files by module \module{d.rast}.
However, this method is quite slow mainly because it is necessary to write data to disk and read them afterwards.
Therefore, this method was rejected for the time being.
There have been efforts to improve the rendering implementation%
\footnote{see related ticket \url{http://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/1719}}
and once it is implemented it will not be a problem to change it also in the \at.

Eventually, the raster rendering is done by \module{r.out.ppm}.
It can send image data to standard output and
thanks to the simplicity of the PPM format (Portable Pixmap Format%
\footnote{\url{http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html}}),
the data are directly (without saving to file) converted into the image displayed in the \at.
The advantage of this solution is that the demanding computation is done inside the module, thus in C.
Moreover, if the module fails for any reason, the application is able to handle such situation and continue.
Still, the achieved performance is worse comparing to \module{xganim}.
This is probably caused by the fact that each call of the module requires not negligible amount of time.
Table \ref{tab:comparisonTime} shows a performance comparison of the described methods.
The time measurement was done on one computer and each number is a sample mean computed from 5 measurements.
To make the measurement more objective, the \module{xganim} source code was slightly
changed by avoiding reporting messages which would slow the loading down.
The absolute numbers are not as important, however when we compare one with another,
we can see that the difference between the new implementation and the original one is not so significant.
Additionally, there is one important aspect which effects the loading duration
significantly for all implementations\,---\,the size of the map.
If we double the size of the image, we can expect the duration to increase four times.

The images are stored internally as \verb|wx.Bitmap| \cite{wxPythonDoc} objects.
The number of bitmaps is not limited programmatically,
however in reality it is limited by the the size of the bitmaps and available RAM.
This is not an issue for usual animations today.

\subsubsection{Window resizing}
Every application has to react on the change of its frame size.
Unlike \module{xganim}, the \at is able to resize the displayed images to fit the new frame size.
However, the images are only rescaled, so it produces less quality images.
On the other hand, the rescaled images are sufficient and the advantage is that
the data do not have to be reloaded every time the user resizes the window.
In the application status bar a warning appears to make the user aware of the fact
that the displayed data should be reloaded.

\subsubsection{Specifying the displayed extent}
The displayed extent of the maps is determined by the computational region%
\footnote{This region defines the geographic area (and resolution) in which all raster analyses are done.}.
To change the displayed region, it is necessary to run module \module{g.region} and then reload data.
At this stage, any interactive zooming would be problematic.
The best option would be to reuse the wxGUI rendering system including zooming in order to avoid code duplication.
Unfortunately, reloading all maps in this way would be more time-consuming.
When the wxGUI rendering system becomes faster
it will hopefully be  possible to reuse this system completely.


\subsubsection{Temporal sampling}
Displaying animation of datasets with unequally spaced intervals or instances is not a simple task.
The \tf which supports the concept of temporal granularity and temporal sampling makes this task feasible.

There are a few computations needed to display the right maps at the right moments.
These steps are the same no matter if there are one or more space time datasets.
The first step is to get the time granularity.
The second step is the sampling of each dataset by the granularity using temporal relation \emph{start}.
This way we get all needed information about the time intervals (or instances) and the names of the maps.
The \at then puts all of this information together.

Table \ref{tab:exampleOfSamplingImpl} shows the result of temporal sampling of two sample space time datasets.
As we can see, the temporal granularity of the dataset $X$ (1 month) differs from the granularity of dataset $Y$ (2 months).
The common granularity (1 month) is in this case easy to compute.
This granularity is then used to sample both datasets (table \ref{tab:exampleOfSamplingImpl-2}).

\subsubsection{Animation}
Animation basically means to display a sequence of images in the given time instances.
Crucial is to determine \emph{which} frame (map) and \emph{when} to display.
We first discuss the \emph{when}  and then the \emph{which} question.


The original \module{xganim} implementation of the animation is rather primitive.
The events are emitted when system becomes idle which the programmer is not able to affect.
Moreover, the delay between two successive frames is done by a for loop
and to change the speed of the animation the number of loops is increased or decreased.
Therefore the default speed of the animation on the current computers is much more faster than it used to be ten years ago.

The \at implementation uses timer events (class wx.Timer provided by wxPython) to achieve regular time intervals between two frames.
The interval between two successive events is specified by the programmer according to what the user requires.
In case of space time datasets animation, the user specifies how long
should a chosen time unit\footnote{units of time supported by the \tf, section \ref{sec:absoluteVsRelative}}
last (in milliseconds).

For each dataset, there is a separate object which controls the animation.
These animation objects receive the timer events and determine
which frame to display according to the result of the temporal sampling explained above.
The timer interval represents the temporal granularity of the datasets.
Therefore, each map is displayed exactly at the right moment.

When the interval of a map takes more than one temporal granularity, internally, there is no redraw.



\subsubsection{Checking compatibility of data}
During the development it was necessary to decide which data are compatible and can be animated together.
Several combinations are possible.
\begin{description}
  \item[Space time dataset $\times$ multiple maps]
  This combination is allowed granted that the number of maps matches the number of maps in the dataset.
  Then, the animation behaves as if there was no temporal information.

  \item[Space time datasets with absolute $\times$ relative time]
  This case is not allowed because there is no obvious way to convert one type to another.

  \item[Space time datasets with interval $\times$ point time]
  This combination is allowed, however it might not behave as user expects.
  Therefore, there is a warning to make the user aware of this fact.
 \end{description}
 
In general, it is better to use data which are fully compatible to avoid confusion.
The \at always checks the user input and in the case it recognizes an incompatibility, it reports it to the user.


\subsubsection{3D view animation}
\label{sec:3dViewAnimation}
Images for 3D view animation must be first rendered by module \module{r.nviz.image} \cite{grassUserMan}.
The rendering is more time-consuming than loading raster maps for the 2D view,
however this does not affect the speed of the animation itself.

3D view animation requires to specify additional input data.
Beside the maps (either multiple maps or space time dataset), the user is asked for a \emph{workspace file}%
\footnote{Workspace file is XML file storing the state of the wxGUI application (e.g.\ loaded layers, displayed extent).}.
The workspace file has to be created during a GRASS wxGUI session with active 3D view,
so that it can provide information about the 3D view state. After parsing this file, a command for \module{m.nviz.image}
is created.
Additionally, the user chooses which parameter to animate.
Typically, it is either \emph{elevation\_map} or \emph{color\_map}
(see the difference between figures \ref{fig:color_map} and \ref{fig:elevation_map}),
although we can animate points or lines, too.

\subsection{Future development}
\begin{itemize}
  \item loading more layers
  \item add where to determine time interval
  \item add legend
  \item better support of formats
  \item 
\end{itemize}



\section{Timeline tool}
Timeline Tool is an interactive application based on wxPython and Python plotting library matplotlib \cite{matplotlib} which allows
the user of the \tf to visualize space time datasets' metadata, especially temporal and spatial extents.

\subsection{Features}
The main purpose of this tool is illustrated by the figure \ref{fig:timeline1}
which is the output plot generated by the tool.

The x-axis represents time and the space time datasets are located on y-axis.
This simple plot gives an immediate overview of the datasets' temporal extent.

Furthermore, it shows also other characteristics of the datasets.
Interval and point datasets are distinguished by different symbols (points and bars)
which is easily and intuitively understandable.
Datasets with relative and absolute time can be recognized by different x-axis tick labels (date/time format vs. integer).

Also, invalid topology of a dataset is visualized.
Invalid topology basically means overlaying intervals or points
which can be easily represented by using semi-transparency to draw plot.
As a result, overlaying intervals are darker
which allows to recognize them (see figure \ref{fig:timeline1}, red dataset topol\_abs8).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[ht]{\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./images/timeline1.pdf}
  \caption{temporal extents}

  \end{subfigure}

  \begin{subfigure}[ht]{\textwidth}

  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./images/timeline3.pdf}
  \caption{annotation}
  \label{fig:timeline3}
  \end{subfigure}
%   
\caption{Timeline Tool: 2D plot of datasets' extents}
\label{fig:timeline}
\end{figure}

Other metadata can be displayed by clicking on the plotted dataset.
An annotation bubble appears showing basic information about the dataset and the selected map (figure \ref{fig:timeline3}).
It also warns about invalid topology of the dataset.


Not only temporal extent but also spatial extent can be visualized by using matplolib extension mplot3d.
The 3D plot is a space time cube where x- and y-axis represent the spatial part and the z-axis represents time (figure \ref{fig:timeline2}).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./images/timeline2.pdf}
  \caption{Timeline Tool: spatial and temporal extents}
  \label{fig:timeline2}
\end{figure}

In order to better explore plotted data, the application allows to zoom,
pan (and in the case of the 3D plot also rotate) the plot.
This functionality is provided by matplotlib's navigation toolbar which is a great advantage both for programmers and users.
Moreover, this toolbar offers to export figure to various raster and vector formats.

\subsection{Implementation}
To achieve nice and interactive plots integrated into wxPython application, matplotlib was chosen as a best option.
Although matplotlib is not a required dependency for GRASS~7,
users often have this library already installed because of its usefulness and capabilities.
Another considered option was a wxPython module wx.lib.plot.
Despite the advantage that it is already a part of wxPython and thus, no other dependency would be required,
it lacks the ability to display time stamps as axis tick labels. This crucial functionality is available in matplotlib.

The Timeline Tool embeds matplotlib into wxPython program by using WXAgg backend.
This enables to integrate the figure canvas and the navigation toolbar
which provides zooming, panning and export functionality.
Beside this toolbar, the Timeline Tool has additional wxPython widgets to control user input.

Matplotlib is a Python library which is an active project and new versions are released approximately two times a year.
Unfortunately, this means that new versions can have different API and new functions unavailable in older versions.
This makes it hard or even impossible to provide the same functionality for all versions.
The Timeline Tool suffers from this problem, too.
The 3D functionality is not available for matplotlib versions older than 1.0.0 (January 2011)
because of slightly different API, the inability to easily combine 2D and 3D subplots in one figure
and the lack of support for alpha drawing.
The Timeline Tool was tested both with an older version 0.99.1 (available for Ubuntu 10.04) and the latest version 1.1.1.

The 3D functionality of matplotlib is still in development and there are many known problems%
\footnote{\url{http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/faq.html}}.
These issues will be hopefully fixed in future versions of matplotlib.
% Therefore, the Timeline Tool's 3D view is m


\subsection{Usage}
The Timeplot Tool can be launched as any other GRASS module.
For displaying help, choose one of the following options:
\begin{small}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mybash]
> g.manual entry=g.gui.timeline # opens manual page in a browser
\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}

\begin{small}
\begin{lstlisting}[style=mybash]
> g.gui.timeline --help

Description:
 Allows to compare temporal datasets
 by displaying their temporal extents in a plot.

Usage:
 g.gui.timeline [-3] [inputs=name[,name,...]] [--verbose] [--quiet]

Flags:
  -3   Show also 3D plot of spatio-temporal extents
 --v   Verbose module output
 --q   Quiet module output

Parameters:
  inputs   Name of the input space time datasets

\end{lstlisting}
\end{small}

\subsection{Future development}
Next development will focus on the following points:
\begin{itemize}
  \item highlighting individual maps, which should be synchronized in 2D and 3D
  \item support for datasets with `mixed' time (time instances and intervals together in one dataset)
  \item user settings\,---\,colors, date formatting
\end{itemize}
In the future, such tool could be integrated into any application processing temporal data
and then, it could be used as a control widget.



\section{\ms}
\ms is a tool which allows the user to interactively compare two raster maps
of the same area by revealing different parts of the raster maps.
It is useful for comparing raster maps from different time periods.
Although \ms does not use the \tf, as there is no particular application for it,
thanks to its capabilities we can regard it as an useful tool for exploring spatio-temporal data.

An example of usage is presented on the manual page \cite{grassUserMan} of the \ms.
