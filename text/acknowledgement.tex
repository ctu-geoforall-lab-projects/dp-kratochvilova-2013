First of all, I would like to thank my family for the encouragement and inspiration.

I would like to thank Martin Landa, my supervisor, for his support

For providing insight into GRASS GIS \tf, as well as
for the opportunity to use it in my thesis, I would like to thank S\"{o}ren Gebbert, its author.

Also, I am grateful to Helena Mitášová for her ideas
which helped me to decide on the topic of my work.

I want to thank Robert Szczepanek for providing me with nice icons for the tools developed within my thesis.

Last, but not least, I would like to thank all the members of the GRASS Development Team and GRASS GIS users
